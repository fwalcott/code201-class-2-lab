<p>Hello. My name is Felicia Walcott. I graduated from Brooklyn College in 2010 with a BFA in Fine Arts. I then got CELTA certification for ESL and  I have been an ESL and general tutor for six years. I am a painter and a printmaker. My goal is to become a full time software developer. I love coding, anime, and coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. I hope you enjoy my page.
